The Billboard Top 100 were choosen because of their availability in decades past. It is noteworthy, still, that they do not represent the music industry as a whole. Our findings thus apply to popular or economically spoken the demand of music (not its supply). Also, we have gathered genre information with use of the Spotify API and assigned each genre to overarching genres by hand. The Spotify API was also used to obtain information on on each song's acoustic features. The latter include Tempo (BPM), Duration (in seconds), Energy (perceptual measure of a song's liveliness) and Danceability (Suitability for dancing based on rythmic features).  Going further, we have trained and implemented a binary classifier to detect of the songs lyrics are in english and made use of the DeepL API if need be for translation."),
